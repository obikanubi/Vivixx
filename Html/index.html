<!-- the browser has predifined styles for certain tags. These tags
are called elements in the browswer. Some of those are:

Headings: <h1>This is a heading element</h1>
Paragraphs: <p>This is a paragraph element</p>
Line break (like pushing enter): <br />
horizontal rule: <hr />

HTML Tag element attributes
Depending on the tag element, each element has some set
attributes. Think of attributes like properties of a class object.

each attribute follows a key value pair rule.

Changing an attribute on an element will affect how that element is
displayed by the browser

An <img> element has a src atribute. If we change what the src value is
we change what that image <img> tag will display

<img src="/images/cat.jpg">

Some other tag elements are (ther are a LOT more):
'Anchor' links (with href attribute):

<a href="pages/about.html">About page</a>

unordered list:
<ul>
  <li>Item 1</li>
  <li>Item 2</li>
</ul>
