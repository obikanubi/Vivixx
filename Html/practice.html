    <h1> Hong Kong's Carrie Lam: 'I am no puppet of Beijing' </h1>
    <h2>Carrie Lam thinks there is a place for her in heaven. "Because I do good things," she says.</h2>

    <p>She tells me this with a straight face.</p>
    <p>In fact, the 60-year-old career civil servant is relentlessly serious during an interview conducted in the chief executive-elect's office, apart from the occasional nervous laugh, glance towards the door and complaint that my questions are unfair.</p>
    <p>To be fair to Mrs Lam, at least she has exposed herself to those questions, and even before taking office. Her predecessor CY Leung granted no BBC interview during five years in the post.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam is a Roman Catholic. Perhaps it is a sense of duty which drove her to seek Hong Kong's top job. It certainly wasn't popularity. She lagged consistently behind her rival in public opinion polls during the campaign, dogged by allegations that she was remote and out of touch.</p>
    <p>She was finally elected on just 777 votes from an electoral committee dominated by pro-business and pro-Beijing figures. With only 0.1% of the public voting for her, I ask how she can claim a mandate to lead Hong Kong.</p>
    <p>"Well, I don't think it's a question of a number. The question is about legitimacy," Mrs Lam says.</p>
    <p>"And as you all know, the election committee by itself is formed from a much larger electorate representing broadly all the sectors in society in Hong Kong."</p>
    <p>But election committees are a sore point. In 2014, Hong Kong saw massive democracy protests precisely because protesters wanted the right to elect their leader without a committee screening the candidates.</p>
