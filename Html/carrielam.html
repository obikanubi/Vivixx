    <h1> Carrie Lam: Hong Kong's new leader faces an uphill battle </h1>
    <h2> Hong Kong's new leader Carrie Lam has almost four decades of public service behind her. </h2>

    <img id="newspic1" src="images/news2.jpg">
    <p>For five years she served as deputy to the man she is now replacing, the unpopular CY Leung. She has been praised as a strong administrator and pragmatic lawmaker, and is undoubtedly Beijing's choice for the role.</p>
    <p>But she is widely disliked by the pro-democracy camp for her stance on political reform.</p>
    <p>When mass rallies erupted in 2014, it was Mrs Lam who defended Beijing's unpopular proposal - to allow Hong Kong people to choose their leader but only from pre-approved candidates - to crowds of protesters demanding full democracy.</p>
    <p>Many have also accused her of being out of touch with voters after gaffes, including a bizarre search for toilet paper and a failure to use a transport swipe card.</p>
