    <h1> Hong Kong chortles over Carrie Lam toilet paper hunt </h1>
    <h2> Run out of toilet paper? Most of us would solve the problem with a quick trip to the shops. </h2>
    <br/>

    <p>But in Hong Kong, politician Carrie Lam took a taxi to her former official residence in the city's exclusive Peak district to fetch more rolls.</p>
    <p>She shared the details of her loo paper adventure to reporters over the weekend, instantly making her a laughing stock on social media.</p>
    <p>"I'm laughing so hard, I'm on the floor," a user called Robhimx wrote on Twitter.</p>
    <p>Mrs Lam is currently seen as Beijing's top pick to become Hong Kong's chief executive, the highest position in the city. But many are now questioning her common sense and her knowledge of the city.</p>
    <p>Some wondered why she couldn't simply ask the housekeeping staff of her serviced residence for toilet paper.</p>
    <p>Or, when she found her local convenience store had no loo paper, why she didn't purchase the ubiquitous tissue packets for temporary use.</p>
    <p>"So, where did she get her toilet paper BEFORE she moved into the government house?" asked another online commentator.</p>
